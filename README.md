Trained graph neural network model for the prediction of bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of organic molecules with C, H, N, and O atoms. 
The model breaks all single, non-cyclic bonds in the input molecules and calculates their bond dissociation energies. 
The model is based on Keras, Tensorflow and makes heavy use of the neural fingerprint library.
Sample data set sourced from relevant blogposts & is commited for reference. However, generation of own dataset is highly recommended.
