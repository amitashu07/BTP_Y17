# BTP_Y17
Trained graph neural network model for the prediction of bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of organic molecules with C, H, N, and O atoms. 
The model breaks all single, non-cyclic bonds in the input molecules and calculates their bond dissociation energies. 
The model is based on Keras, Tensorflow and makes heavy use of the neural fingerprint library.
